<h1>Midterms Matter Too!</h1>


<h2>By Adam Turner</h2>

<div id="intro">
<p>Midterm elections famously have a significantly lower turnout than presidential elections in the United States — much to the ire of congressional leaders of the party that doesn't control the White House. However, the 2018 midterm elections are notable for having the highest voter turnout in recent years with <a href="https://www.census.gov/library/stories/2019/04/behind-2018-united-states-midterm-election-turnout.html">53% of the voting age population turning out</a> casting ballots. The trends in recent years are fascinating because since 2016, the decreasing levels of voter participation took a dramatic, positive shift, especially among younger voters. As such, it's worth taking a look at the trends of different age groups in the since the start of the 21st century.</p>

<p>As shown in the graph above, the demographic with the highest voter turnout rate are those over the age of 65. Oftentimes, these individuals are already retired or are working reduced hours, and as such, they have the time to be able to go to the polls. In the 2018 midterm elections, every age group saw an increase in their turnout in the polls — espeically the younger age ranges. This is in large part as a reaction to President Trump and grassroots youth-powered efforts to get out the vote from advocacy organizations such as March For Our Lives. The high midterm turnout reflects a growing resentment of the decisions being made by older generations in the polls and the hope to counteract the results of the 2016 election. Ultimately, the results of that higher turnout was a so-called "blue wave" in which Democrats managed to reclaim the House of Representatives from Republicans.</p>

<p>One of the <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/02/05/democrats-want-to-make-election-day-a-national-holidayheres-why.html">debates within those discussing electoral fairness</a> is whether or not federal election day should be considered a national holiday where people either get off from work or get to leave early in order to make it to the polls. In fact, the first piece of legislation the newly established House of Representatives passed, the "For The People" bill, included just such a measure in it. However, Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell kept the bill from a vote in the upper chamber, stopping that piece of legislation. Based on the data of this graph, however, election day as a federal holiday would be a good idea as being too busy was the number one reason people don't go to the polls for working-age people. When only half the voting age makes it to the polls — especially due to structural reasons — it bring up the question of whether the government is representative of the populations' views or if it is purposely set up to discourage certain age groups from voting.</p>
